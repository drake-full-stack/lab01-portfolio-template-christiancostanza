## üìù Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:
- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

Figuring out how much is enough for the criteria for the assignments, was only a bit difficult. There were some quick issues I ran into like having to figure out how to make a new line for things to be better organized but that only took a few minutes.

I learned how important it is to keep those organized so that your code is much more readible. 

I would love to add bootstrap or css to make it more appealing, I also would like to finish the projects page and finish the full three pages.

*This portfolio will grow throughout the semester as you add React components and full-stack projects!*
